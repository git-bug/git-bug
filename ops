The next example in the README definitely requires the quote (in Bash on Linux) to escape the space:\n\n```\ngit bug ls \"foo bar\" baz\n```\n\nClearly it would be possible to fix the README but making the argument parsing more robust would be more user-friendly.  I'll take a look at whether the command-line parsing code in Cobra is platform dependent.  I'm also wondering if there's a way to test this for all OSes and shells we support.","files":null}]}
