This should change in the future once the identity system become smarter. For now, maybe it's best to match whatever is possible in git-bug core?\n\nRegarding the authentication, there is three different scenario:\n- the user might might not have an identity yet (that is, `Repository.userIdentity` *can* be nil in GraphQL). In that case we want to have a read-only UI if we don't have a user yet.\n- in the future, the webUI might be used for a public portal (possibly with external auth like github OAuth where identities would be imported in git-bug at first login). Again, we want a read-only view when we don't have a user logged in yet.\n- the webUI can be started with `--read-only` to force a read-only view.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1612177184,"nonce":"xDdPjRF8w7/ku2mnJxhNjFCIL2A=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDc2OTU0Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/158#issuecomment-770769546"},"message":"So in the react code, the write-enabled part of the UI are guarded with the `IfLoggedIn` component.","files":null}]}
