IIRC github requires that you use a personal access token instead of your password, so your workflow would look something like this:\n\u003e \n\u003e ```\n\u003e ➜ git remote get-url origin\n\u003e https://github.com/sudoforge/test.git\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e ➜ git pull\n\u003e Username for 'https://github.com': \u003cusername\u003e\n\u003e Password for 'https://github.com': \u003cpersonal access token\u003e\n\u003e ``` \n\nGit does not give me those prompts, I can pull and push without having to authenticate each time.\n\n\u003e in the meantime, you can solve this in a couple of different ways.\n\u003e \n\u003e * changing your git remote to https://\u003cuser\u003e:\u003ctoken\u003e@github.com/foo/bar.git\n\u003e * RECOMMENDED: use ssh instead; this is more secure and generally a better way to use git for private repositories (anywhere; not just for ones on github).\n\nThe second option does not work. It gives me this error\n\n`Error: error creating SSH agent: \"SSH agent requested, but could not detect Pageant or Windows native SSH agent\"`\n\nIt happens in both CLI and termui. In CLI I used `git bug push origin` and `git bug pull origin` with the recommended configuration with SSH.\n\nI then tried the first option.\n\nThis first option works for `git bug push origin2` and `git bug pull origin2` where origin2 is a new remote with the corresponding configuration. If I drop the `origin2` remote en both commands, then it does not work, but I don't know if these commands are intended to work if I do not give them remotes explicitly. In TUI push and pull do not work and give the same error as in the second option. Maybe this happens because I cannot explicitly pick in TUI which remote I want to use.\n\nI can push and pull normally from/to my repo using just git with both options.","files":null}]}
