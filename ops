I'm a user of the the GitLab project and not an administrator. I can't just make a full backup of the whole project. GitLab's own issues export for users is weak (CSV file!?).\n\nI am hoping that `git-bug` gives me another way to export all the communication from issues and pull requests.\n\n`git-bug` already apparently does this for GitLab issues, which is a great start. I can use it to browse the communication on GitLab issues even when I don't have access to GitLab.com. I want the same experience for pull requests.\n\nI don't care about the code-review features of a pull request. The part that matters to me is the part that is like an issue: the stream of comments.\n\nI think it would be great if git-bug could at least list which pull requests exist and archive their descriptions and lists of comments on them. I realize that might be complicated by the fact that pull requests have the concept of comments on revisions and lines, but I can live without that context if it's hard to capture. What matters most is who said what when.\n\nI had some trouble getting started with `git-bug` earlier (#1327) so I ended up using another simpler tool to export all the GitLab issues from a project. ([mklilley/gitlab-issue-backup](https://github.com/mklilley/gitlab-issue-backup)).\n\nThat other tool doesn't address GitLab pull requests either. So right now there is a gap in my archiving.\n\nMy workaround for this gap is to keep all project-oriented communication in an issue and out of the pull request. If anything important does leak into a pull request, I'll have to copy and link it in a corresponding issue.","files":null}]}
