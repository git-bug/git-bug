Phrased differently, I think the solution implemented should be one-size-fits-all, without any particular requirement for the end user to install a specific password manager that implements that API.\n\nTo that end, `git-credentials` is a good candidate, as it can proxy out to an external command, e.g. `gopass`, `op` (1Password's CLI), or a script the user writes that performs whatever necessary logic to fetch their password.","files":null}]}
