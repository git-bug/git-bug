Today I upgraded to the latest git bug and it seems most commands yield this error:\n\n```\n✔ danl@Dans-iMac 11:43 [~/proj/myproject master]\n└─ $ git bug ls\nA lock file is present but the corresponding process is not, removing it.\nBuilding identity cache... Done.\nBuilding bug cache... Error: failed to decode OperationPack json: invalid character '+' looking for beginning of value\nUsage:\n  git-bug ls [\u003cquery\u003e] [flags]\n[...]\n```\n\nI understand there've been changes that aren't be backwards compatible so I do not have the expectation that my bug db is recoverable. My 2 questions:\n\n1. How can I fix this error (if it is indeed fixable)...\n2. And if it isn't, how can I remove the bug db and start a new one?\n\nThanks!\nDan","files":null}]}
