I'm not sure if this exists?\n\nCurrently git-bug source the `Name` and `Email` from the git configuration.

A good example would be the set of labels: out of the box, any label is valid. Once a config is defined, only those are accepted as valid.\n- if there is a need to do an opinionated default choice, it should favor a small project/team. Bigger team will have the time to tweak git-bug as needed.\n- user should not have to know how and where the configuration is stored to manage it. Power user can still edit the config directly if they want (kind of like the `.git/config` file)","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1538910894,"nonce":"ZQe6CT6IKiEvbecAZ7GtII6yzHI=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzY0NTA3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/63#issuecomment-427645074"},"message":"I see different way to store the project scoped config:\n\n- (1) simple config file (`.git-bug`) stored with the code\n  - Pros\n    - obvious for the user\n    - simple\n  - Cons\n    - branch scoped, this can lead to some operation considered invalid because the current branch has a different config\n    - pollute the code\n\n- (2) a simple hidden ref holding a series of commit, each commit holding the full config\n  - Pro\n    - actually global scoped\n    - simple\n    - store the full history of the config\n  - Cons\n    - hidden\n    - can have conflict with concurrent edition, conflict that will need to have a way to be resolved\n\n- (3) a hidden ref holding a series of commit, each commit holding an edit operator, a for the bug data\n  - Pro\n    - actually global scoped\n    - conflict are resolved automatically\n    - store the full history of the config\n  - Cons\n    - hidden\n    - complex\n\nOne thing to note is that the configuration will change very rarely, and probably by a unique person at a time.
