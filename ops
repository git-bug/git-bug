E.g. I have my git-bug fork on GitHub and on GitLab. Suppose that I have the following usernames\n\nGitHub -\u003e Sascha\nGitLab -\u003e Foobar\n\nMy `git config user.name` can only match one of both services. Let's say it matches Sascha.\nNow importing bugs via the GitHub bridge will result into bugs created by me, with Sascha as author.\nNext I import via the GitLab bridge the bugs from GitLab. Those bugs who are created by me, will be displayed with Sascha as author. But if I wouldn't know now better, I would expect those bugs to be displayed with _Foobar_ as author.\n\nWell I know now better and the design of git-bug makes perfect sense. :+1: \n\n\u003e * try to be smart and see if the name of the git-bug identity match the github one ... but that would probably introduce more weirdness and confusion\n\nI agree, this seems to be not the right solution.\n\n\u003e * ask the user for confirmation before mapping the current identity (scenario 1), otherwise create a new identity\n\nThis sound fine to me.\n\nMaybe the `git-bug user ls` command could be improved to make thinks more clear. E.g. following output\n\n```\n6ac33cd Michael Muré (MichaelMure)\n94c90ef timbkr (timbkr)\n723b0b4 TestUser **(This is you)**\n|\u003e GlancingMind (on GitHub)\n|\u003e Foo (on GitLab)\n| ...\na76df02 Cláudio Silva (claudioantonio)\n7d8b135 LenaNoctua (LenaNoctua)\n```\n\n---\n\nPart of my confusion is probably also due to that I thought, my GitHub identity would be a separate one. E.g. similar to this:\n\n```\n000000 Foo (Bar)\n6ac33cd Michael Muré (MichaelMure)\n94c90ef timbkr (timbkr)\n999999 Sascha (GlancingMind) \n723b0b4 TestUser **(This is you)**\n|\u003e you are also, 999999 Sascha (GlancingMind), on GitHub\n|\u003e you are also 000000 Foo (Bar) (on GitLab)\n| ...\na76df02 Cláudio Silva (claudioantonio)\n7d8b135 LenaNoctua (LenaNoctua)\n```","files":null}]}
