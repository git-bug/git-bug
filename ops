Maybe issues come from 2019 and already solved?)\n\ni did a cursory search before posting the issue here and saw recent complaints of the same; and if we look at that issue, there's activity from the past year.\n\n\u003e better touse \"GitHub solution\" + allow to pick font\n\nyep, i think this is what we're going to have to do. so, **this issue** will track the refactoring for defining a better default font family, and #1452 will track the feature request for making it configurable.","files":null}]}
