See https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/130\n\n\u003e should measures preventing that be the default or optional?\n\u003e would each user decide whether they want to use a secure way of identity management, or each repo, or a mix/combination of the two?\n\nMy view is that as a general UX principle git-bug should have a default that is 1) functional with little to no configuration 2) address a wide range of use cases and 3) allow to add additional constraint to restrict to a more specific use case.\n\nFor this problem in particular, I think the best way would be:\n- default would have no crypto keys. Identity theft is possible but that's not a problem in a lot of real life scenario (you would first need to have git write access). Identities are marked as \"unprotected\".\n- it's possible for each user to opt-in and protect their identity by adding keys\n- when a project config exist, add a settings to enforce having keys for each identities\n\n\u003e is avatar-URL really enough, or should the avatar image rather (optionally) be stored in the repo?\n\nIt's very crude at the moment. Yes, it should be improved and stored in the repo if possible.\n\n\u003e I feel like such decisions are really hard, and in the end will always have to be changed later on, as one did not think of everything from the start, so the most important thing in my eyes, is to use versioning, and in such a way that really everything can be changed, if deemed necessary, or even just beneficial.\n\nIf by versioning you mean data model versioning, it's already there. Every piece of data stored in git has this version number. It's especially important because those are immutable. It's not really used though at the moment.\n\n\u003e what is the _login_ used for?\n\nAn identity's login is optional and is only meant to store the login used on the bridge that created this identity. It's just informational, to display in the UI both full name and login when available. This exist in part because Github mainly display the login (so you know people by that name) so if you don't have the login in git-bug's UI you can see names you have never seen before even though you know the people.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1591113266,"nonce":"yGi89Zx6/LiAGnpb1EsDSwYUnZk=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzY0MjgwMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/55#issuecomment-637642801"},"message":"Not super knowledgeable about DID but AFAIK they don't work offline ?\n\nNote that identities in git-bug is just an interface (https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/identity/interface.go).
