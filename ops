The solution is not to have a new command, but to make `pull` fail later, only when we do need to have an identity (to merge data) instead of a hard requirement to do any pull. This would cover your scenario as you would pull data without having to do any merge (you don't have data locally yet, nothing to merge).\n\nhttps://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/1003#issuecomment-1411803779","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1691691811,"nonce":"CPLgqybEF5jLSetml+KidOwtG+A=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOCGKeh85nHQFlzwAAAAJXxvbJ"},"status":2}]}
