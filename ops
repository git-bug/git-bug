I couldn’t find anything in Go to convert Markdown to ANSI codes, but I did find [this Node library](https://github.com/stephenmathieson/node-ansimd). Alternatively, since Markdown tries to be human-readable, it could be output as-is on terminals. Support could eventually be added to style bold/italics as they’re supposed to be styled while fading out the `*`/`_` delimiters. Similar things could be done for inline code (fade out the `` ` ``) and code blocks (fade out the ` ``` ` and syntax-highlight the code based on the language tag).","files":null}]}
