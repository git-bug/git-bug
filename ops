This is happening in `termbox`, the low level access to the terminal, when being called by `gocui`, the library we use to draw the termui. As you can see, the stacktrace doesn't even mention git-bug's own code, which means it's happening either because of a bad state created by git-bug, or a bug in gocui or termbox.\n\nCould you try to reproduce with `GOTRACEBACK=all` set ? This should dump the stracktrace of all the goroutines, maybe there is something in there.","files":null}]}
