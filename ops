The scp like syntax does not allow setting a custom port number.\n\nCurrent status for me on version `0.9.0` is:\n\n- A SSH Agent is still needed. If I try a `git bug pull` or push without starting an agent, I get:\n\u003e Error: error creating SSH agent: \"SSH agent requested but SSH_AUTH_SOCK not-specified\"\n\n-  `~/.ssh/config` is not honored.\n\nHope you can find the time to fix both and get git-bug to seamlessly work just like git. ;)","files":null}]}
