Apart from the general stuff, my next step is support for project board (https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/pull/843). This feature is to me the beacon to follow to have all the layers in git-bug ready to accept new entities (pull-request being the next obvious one).\n\nWith https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/pull/938 being ironed out, this extensive refactor/rewrite work is near its term.\n\nAs for supporting pull-request, there is a bunch of design steps that would greatly help, before even writing any code:\n- what would the data model look like? \n- what interactions are supported?\n- what would the CLI tooling looks like? (there is a bunch of existing CLI tool doing code review already, would be cool to nail the UX)\n- does that means we need to have a code explorer first? if so, how do we implement that?\n\nObviously, help welcome :-)","files":null}]}
