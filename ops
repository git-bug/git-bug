(you can redact the user and repo names if you'd prefer)**\n\n```\ngit remote get-url --all origin\n```\n\n---\n\n**what happens if you run `git bug push` on the command line?**\n\nthis uses `go-git` under the hood to push and pull from your remote. you should be prompted to unlock your authentication key (unless it's already cached).\n\nif this works for you without error, then the problem you were likely encountering is simply that your key wasn't cached when you tried to push/pull in the TUI. git-bug doesn't currently have a way to handle this from the TUI (which... yeah, sucks). in the TUI, when i push or pull with an uncached ssh key, my pinentry program starts, but the TUI still intercepts the keys and all sort of chaos occurs such that i can't enter my passphrase.","files":null}]}
