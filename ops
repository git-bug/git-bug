Some things can be solved with sub-issues. But we also have cases where multiple departments are involved that each run their own Jira projects. With linking them together we can keep track of what is all involved.\n\nEspecially when we have recurring tasks, the link issue feature helps tracking down how it was done last time. Copying the task or just the text and adapting it saves a lot of time.\n\nEssentially it boils down to the question if git-bug is just for tracking bugs, or how well it could also be used as a project management tool.","files":null}]}
