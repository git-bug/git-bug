However, i want to expand the vision of distributed development.\n\n\nI think it would be very interesting if pull requests would also be supported in the same way as bugs. For projects such as [lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) this would be a really great feature, because lemmy has at the moment 3 repositories on github, gitea and gitlab. So you can make a pull request on any of those platforms, but for the issues you have to look at github.\n\nI think a really great improvement would be to decentralize pull requests the same way as bugs. That could allow a development style where you just have different mirrors on github, gitea, gitlab, etc. but for the bugs and pull requests you can use `git-bug`, so you wouldnt need to use github or so.\n\nAnd it would make this decentralized style of development actually easier than the status quo, since you do not need to look up multiple places (gitlab, github, gitea) to find out if a pull request has already done something you want to do. You just can look that up in `git-bug`.\n\nSo i think this would be really exciting to avoid being dependent on github or so. You can use github to gain popularity and being easily found, but you github is actually not important for the project as it is just another code mirror.","files":null}]}
