In order to enable this behavior, the \"core\" should have the following traits:\n\n- [ ] There should be no output to `stdout`\n- [ ] Minimize the amount of output to `stderr`\n- [ ] During \"core\" initialization, both `stdout` and `stderr` should be redirectable.\n- [ ] All error conditions should be returned to callers via Go `error`s without output to either `stdout` or `stderr`.","files":null}]}
