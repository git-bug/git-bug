Take a look at https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/affde987ab14507de7edfccb4b4913a5834d0d9b/repository/gogit_testing.go#L41 but please be advised that this branch is a mess because a) it's based off the branch with the failing test and b) I've tried several dozens of ideas including finding the races.  Assuming it's okay with you, my plan was to start from `master`, and then apply a similar set of refactors.","files":null}]}
