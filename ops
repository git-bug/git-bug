This means that there is likely a data loss when merging occurs. As explained, I don't think it would happen often, as comment edition will be limited to a few persons (author, admin ...), but still. We could at some point leverage git to actually merge the changes and redure even further the problem. As you might think as well, it's not ideal as well for storage size, but git's delta compression should really limit that problem.\n- I expect an auto-push feature to exist at some point to reduce the risk of having to merge anything\n- It would be nice to have multiple non-pushed edition automatically merged in one locally","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1618683518,"nonce":"p/oTjo7qqdqJtOIFZF/KbuYnf5g=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTg2NTM3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/105#issuecomment-821865374"},"message":"Closing as it's not an issue.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1618683518,"nonce":"WatF9b2RRgBMtA57UN5T8kBAwaU=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDYwODI0NDM1NA=="},"status":2}]}
