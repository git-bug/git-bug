I'll try to explain.\n1. `git bug bridge push/pull`: Export and import bugs to some external bug tracker e.g. GitHubs Issue Tracker or Jira.\n2. `git-bug push`: This commands works without a configured bridge. It  pushes the \"raw\" bug database (stored in your local .git directory) to the remote *origin* repository. In effect `git-bug push` is a disguised `git push` :-).\n\nAs far as I know, the push/pull operations in the TermUI only support `git-bug push/pull` commands. So the TermUI doesn't make use of your configured bridges.\nTLDR: exporting and importing of bugs from another bug tracker seem to be not supported by the TermUI. So if you want to manage your GitHub Issues via git-bug, you have to use the commandline with `git-bug bridge push/pull`.\n\n---\n\nTo your error. The second command `git bug bridge push` succeeds as ssh is not used by the bridge.\nWhile your first command `TermUI::Push` uses ssh to `git push` your git-bug database to your remote repository.\n\nUnfortunately this might not solve your error with the TermUI, but does calling `git-bug push` fail also with the same error as the TermUI push?","files":null}]}
