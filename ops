The team at the moment is composed of:\n- myself, working on git-bug on the side of my regular job\n- @A-Hilaly, who joined through the google summer of code program, also working on the side of his normal student commitment\n- a few people contributing occasionally\n\nIf you want to help, I'd say do as with any free software: make it yours, use it, report bugs of feature request and if you can contribute in the form of code or documentation (very useful !). There is also an [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/git-bug) that could be useful someday.  I'm still curious who you actually are though ;)","files":null}]}
