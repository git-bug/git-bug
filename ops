This is, in my opinion, a much more idiomatic way to parse configuration values, as well as allowing the user to manage where their configuration is stored.\n\nFor writes, writing to the global configuration is probably fine. Better yet, we could allow a flag to choose a particular configuration file for writing (e.g. `--global`, `--local`, `--file \u003cpath\u003e`).","files":null}]}
