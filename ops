I don't really see the point in separating the two, it will bring more issues than it will solve.\n\n\u003eDon't make the mistake and expect the users to be stupid. The target group are developers and alike, not computer-noobs that don't know the difference from linux and windows.\n\nThat's rather rude, not everyone is a capable linux professional, even now there's probably quite a few devs that have only had experience with Windows based systems.\n\n\u003eI am not a fan of every new software I get to have a standalone web server that I can't maintain and/or configure/harden etc.\n\nAs person above me already covered this, this is not a public server, it's meant for *your* personal use only.\n\nI am not a fan of unix holy warriors complaining on every new software doing things differently.","files":null}]}
