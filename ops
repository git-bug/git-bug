Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.\n\nThis issue can includes four tasks:\n\n1. Make sure all output from packages other than `commands` is sent to `StdErr`.  A perfect example of the correct way to inform a human user than an action has completed can be found at: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/bc5f618eba812859bf87ce2c31b278bd518d4555/cache/repo_cache.go#L194.\n2. Make sure that all output from the `commands` package is properly split between `StdErr` and `StdOut` so that a human reader sees the full context of what has occurred but a program processing the output of the command is presented only with data that's easy for a machine to process.  A great example of how this should be done can be found at: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/bc5f618eba812859bf87ce2c31b278bd518d4555/commands/user_create.go#L73\n3. Add minimal tests for all CLI commands to verify the output text is correct.\n4. Make sure that all CLI commands that return errors also return a non-zero exit code.  If a command is executed successfully, it should return a zero exit code.","files":null}]}
