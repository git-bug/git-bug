You can safely delete those and git-bug will recompute them next launch, but it does need a place to store them.\n\nCurrently, git-bug store those file in `.git/git-bug/`. The `.git` folder is found using the `git rev-parse --show-top-level` command, which notably doesn't work for a bare repository or if you are already inside the .git folder.\n\nSo nothing really preventing from fixing this problem, we just need to come up to the good solution.","files":null},{"type":2,"timestamp":1562580267,"nonce":"hyrPyKMzXwa9b8X07MQ/Ns2jwDY=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjQ2NTYwMDkzNg=="},"title":"git-bug doesn'y work in bare repository","was":"git-bug doesn't work in bare repository"},{"type":5,"timestamp":1562580272,"nonce":"V8Imygjw9Sq846Jv4rp9dS+Kbg8=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0NjU2MDExNzU="},"added":["kind/bug"],"removed":[]}]}
