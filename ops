(Currently I am using git-bug from PR #585).\n\nWhen the import is finished the number of open and closed issues in git-bug and on github do not match. For example, github has 4298 open and 15884 closed issues in nixpkgs but git-bug shows the following:\n\n```          \n$ git-bug ls --status open | wc -l\n    4317\n$ git-bug ls --status closed | wc -l\n   15865\n```\n\nThis is caused by github having issues which are closed, but which seem to not have a ClosedEvent (as described in their API https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#closedevent). An example of such an issue is https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90920.","files":null}]}
