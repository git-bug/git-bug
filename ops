I've been using git-bug for a while and had and awesome experience with it,\nexcept for a small annoying bug: i configured a bridge to my private GitHub\nrepo and exported the issues, then I deleted that repo and tried to re-export\nthe issues to a new repo without success.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n* Setup a GtiHub bridge `br1`\n* Run `git bug bridge push br1`. It will create the issues successfully\n* Setup a second GitHub bridge `br2`. This one should use a GitHub repo different than `br1`'s\n* Run `git bug bridge push br2`. It will say `exported 0 issues with br2 bridge` and won't export\n  anything into the second repo\n\nAs a workaround, I was able to make `git bug bridge push br2` export the issues\nby changing the name of the GitHub metadata keys:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/bridge/github/github.go b/bridge/github/github.go\nindex 1e85eb9..14448d3 100644\n--- a/bridge/github/github.go\n+++ b/bridge/github/github.go\n@@ -15,8 +15,8 @@ import (\n const (\n \ttarget = \"github\"\n \n-\tmetaKeyGithubId    = \"github-id\"\n-\tmetaKeyGithubUrl   = \"github-url\"\n+\tmetaKeyGithubId    = \"github-id-2\"\n+\tmetaKeyGithubUrl   = \"github-url-2\"\n \tmetaKeyGithubLogin = \"github-login\"\n \n \tconfKeyOwner        = \"owner\"\n```\n\nWith this change, git-bug won't mark the existing issues as already exported.\n\nOne possible solution to this problem would be to make the GitHub metadata keys\nkeyed with the bridge name, so a bug can be marked as exported in just one\nGitHub bridge instead of in all of them.\n\nI don't need this issue to be fixed since my plan was to use git-bug only until\nI release my tool, and then move to GitHub issues. Using the workaround\ndescribed above was enough for me. But I wanted to create the issue to prevent\nothers from having this same problem.","files":null}]}
