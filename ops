Wondering if you think this is better thanthe CRDT approach ?\n\nBut anyway i was thinking about how lots of users have to fork and then manage setting up the brnahc and then doing a PR. It can be tricky for new golang users. SO i want to suggest that this be incorporated later. I saw a repo in golang just the other day that did this.\n\nanyway, hope to hear your thoughts. The code base looks really clean and easy to follow and i want to congratulate you on this excellent work.\n\nIn terms of a github server, do you envisage users using gitea or other ?","files":null}]}
