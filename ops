They use exactly as much space as what's there currently.\n\nFor symbols, I think my current visual favourites are dots or triangles\n\n```\n[q]·Quit [s]·Search [←↓↑→,hjkl]·Navigation [↵]·Open bug [n]·New bug [i]·Pull [o]·Push\n```\n\n```\n[q]►Quit [s]►Search [←↓↑→,hjkl]►Navigation [↵]►Open bug [n]►New bug [i]►Pull [o]►Push\n```\n\nI haven't tried the colours yet because that's more effort.","files":null}]}
