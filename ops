If so perhaps it can be documented in relevant places.\n\nBTW: I'm very impressed with my brief experiments so far and will continue to look at using git-bug in my attempt to build a decentralised (p2p) alternative to the existing github style experience. If it looks promising I'll open an issue about that. I posted briefly in the gitter about it this week, but have not seen a response there yet.\n\nIf any git-bug users or contributors are present on mastodon or twitter please let me know as I would like to follow you.","files":null}]}
