But I can tell you what I would try:\n\n1. You should put the nixpkg repo in a tmpfs (`mount -t tmpfs`) because there is a big number of issues in nixpkg and git-bug writes more data than necessary on your disk while importing. Using a tmpfs might help you to speed up the import.\n\n2. You can try to decrease the size of the queries to the github server here: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/b2f0e126a10b5f030bfc35cac4b0cabcf083b589/bridge/github/import_mediator.go#L12-L15\nThese are the number of items requested from the server with one query. You could start by reducing `NumIssues`. If it doesn't work, try to reduce the other ones, too. This will slow the import down, but it might enable you to get a full import without error. If you have success with this method, please let me know which numbers you used.\n\n3. You can increase the number of retries in case the github server has an error:\nhttps://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/b2f0e126a10b5f030bfc35cac4b0cabcf083b589/bridge/github/client.go#L110\n\nI hope that helps. Let us know how it is going.","files":null}]}
