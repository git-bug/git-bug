Included in those changes are label changes (https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/bridge/gitlab/import.go#L296-L318). Something is going wrong in there as the importer is trying to add a **empty string** label on a bug. The core of git-bug is validating the data and refusing to do so.\n\nSo, the big question is why is there an empty string label. Once you have figured that out, the fix should be easy-ish.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1661858601,"nonce":"C+3JovPlo9ejSidW90SxPzuLoPk=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOCGKeh85PKuDPzwAAAAGyUIQ3"},"added":["area/cli"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1668965113,"nonce":"vuOeV8W68H8XnUknK7VtoA7behc=","metadata":{"github-id":"UNLE_lADOCGKeh85PKuDPzwAAAAHUAiAZ"},"added":[],"removed":["area/cli"]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1668965113,"nonce":"CelAwjOgOgGRe74lvhqXZk6g7+c=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOCGKeh85PKuDPzwAAAAHUAiAa"},"added":["kind/bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1668965113,"nonce":"d1OHm2T7WwYsIWGv3hYLWlcoVJs=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOCGKeh85PKuDPzwAAAAHUAiAb"},"added":["area/bridge"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1668965133,"nonce":"f7vR9PKrwVYxk4b23uZX5BG1/so=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOCGKeh85PKuDPzwAAAAHUAiIM"},"added":["Easy pick"],"removed":[]}]}
