They are both GPLv3 so it should be completely safe, and likely advantageous to do so, if just to avoid pitfalls and traps either has gone through. It would be useful for example to have some documentation in both repos whether they are compatible or convertible, and what the differences might be. This discussion task is not really intended to create more work for the creators (though they are welcome), but rather as a todo for us users/uninitiated to investigate and discuss.\n\nhttps://github.com/dspinellis/git-issue/issues/97","files":null}]}
