Ideally I'd set up a pull hook to run something like `git-bug ls --format org-mode \u003e issues.org`, so the issues are somewhat up to date. I'd prefer to have all discussions in this file, but if it goes against the idea of what `ls` command should do (i.e. an overview) -- I'm okay for now, even having the titles and being able to quickly jump to the specific bug on github is already really great. Maybe later we can reconsider it, or add another mode, etc :) \nWith regards to Markdown -- I'm fairly indifferent about markdown vs org-mode in general for such scenarios (i.e. a read-only plaintext dump), but org-mode has better builtin primitives for working with structured data. For Markdown -- even if we come up with some custom format, not sure if there is much point if no tools support it. And if you don't get any primitives (tags/states/dates), you could as well just use `.org` file, it's plaintext too.","files":null}]}
