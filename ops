The `default` value of `OutputFormat` produces the following output (only one bug shown):\n\n```\n7daec5d open\\tthis is a bug title                               \\tJohn Doe       \\t\\n\n```\n\nThis output is almost TSV compatible but would require that the space following the hash prefix be replaced by a tab.  For a human, any shell with a tab size of 2, 4 or 8 characters would still result in the output being displayed with a single space after when viewed.  It would however make machine processing of the output much simpler.\n\nThis issue would involve analyzing (and updating where needed) the following `OutputFormat`s:\n\n- [ ] default\n- [ ] ~org-mode~\n- [ ] ~plain~\n- [ ] ~json~\n- [ ] ~compact~","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1659364936,"nonce":"b5XDqtNUlX5qW0a63aaiDK5xzU4=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOCGKeh85Hmldl","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/836#issuecomment-1201297253"},"message":"@MichaelMure - If this makes sense, please assign it to me and I'll take care of it before finishing #828.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1660817632,"nonce":"9oRo5GNa9X9zvl8qj1JomTXLeQg=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOCGKeh85IrSkY","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/836#issuecomment-1219307800"},"message":"After looking through the code for the `ls` formatting functions, I realized that a) the `org-mode` and `json` formatters already provide machine parseable output and b) we really only need one of the three text output formatters to be \"regular\".  Since the `default` formatter is already using tabs for most of its field separators, changing that format makes the most sense.\n\nUsing the `default` formatter for field-oriented operations has an additional side effect as you can simple type `git but ls` without having to specify a formatter - e.g. `git bug ls -f compact`.  One caveat is that the label indicators are still right-aligned in the same field as the title.  We may want to change this in the future.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1660825565,"nonce":"mZ0WNTSL0xwCTVipNzytFa9lye0=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOCGKeh85O8tTazwAAAAGt--rf"},"status":2}]}
