This complicates the CLI experience (see #1193).\n\nWe can (probably) make bridge integration transparent, by storing bridge state locally and refactoring `git-bug-{push,pull}` to iterate over any configured bridge(s), transparent to the user, such that they do not need to explicitly run `git-bug-bridge-{push,pull}` in order to interact with the remote.","files":null}]}
