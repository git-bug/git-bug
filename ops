Bridges have limitations that translate into UX issues (like the confusion in that comment):\n- bridges can't push the events that are not owned by a known account (one we have an auth for), so (almost always) we can't push everything. This alone prevent bridges from being \"transparent\".\n- git-bug **on-purpose** prevent from pulling from one bridge and pushing to another, because that would cause more problems than it would resolve\n\nImho, the solution is to try to address the confusion directly. Possibly, rename the `push`/`pull` bridge operations to `import`/`export` to make then feel less \"native\" (ie, with limitation)?","files":null}]}
