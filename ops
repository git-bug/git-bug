Thanks for working on git bug.\n\nWhen creating a label containing a colon \":\" character, the search seems to become unusable in the terminal user interface. After adding the label \"st:wontfix\" to a bug I tried to search with each of these: \n\n- label:st:wontfix\n- label:\"st:wontfix\"\n- label:'st:wontfix'\n\nEach threw the error \"can't tokenize\". \n\nI would expect that either the colon character should be made illegal, or some other escape sequence be adopted to allow the search to cope with colons","files":null}]}
