Instead, we could implement a system which looked for other binaries, such as `git-bug-bridge-\u003cname\u003e`, which implemented a common bridge interface maintained within `git-bug`. These other binaries could be maintained by the community, instead of adding the source code directly into `git-bug`.\n\n**Pros**\n- Distributed workload for managing bridges\n- Reduced risk of introducing code into `git-bug` that goes stale (unmaintained)\n- Better ability to focus on core feature set instead of third party, often proprietary integrations\n- _Can you think of another benefit? Please add a comment below._\n\n**Cons**\n- Installation might become more complex for users because they'll need to find bridges. We might maintain a central list of bridges, or support a sort of \"plugin registry\".\n- _Can you think of another con? Please add a comment below._","files":null}]}
