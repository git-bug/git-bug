Having this kind of feature would require git-bug to track changes in the normal branches and edit bugs accordingly.\n\nMaybe git-bug could install a hook to spy on the normal workflow and trigger these changes ? The problem is that every single commiter of the repo would need to have git-bug installed or some of these events would be missed.","files":null}]}
