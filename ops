Add a comment to a repo's `.git/config`\n 2. Run `git bug bridge pull`\n 3. Look at `.git/config` and see the comment has gone\n\nDesired behavior:\n 1. comments preserved, everything outside of the git-bug area preserved\n 5. `git bug` doesn't edit the config at all unless it needs to, rather than on every operation\n\nAffirmed behavior still present in current HEAD:\n\n```\ngit-bug version: v0.8.0-dev-55e4046b4b\n```","files":null}]}
