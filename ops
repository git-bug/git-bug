Just got the software working on my machine, and here are some things that would have made my life easier:\n\n- a guide which release file is the right one for the most common Linux distros\n- a full example for the installation progress in Linux, including making the file executable and a ready-made `mv` command to move it into path\n- an explanation that `git bug user create` in fact pulls in your standard git identity, and you don't have to bother with `adopt` in the default case\n- making sure that what you get when you use `--help` on a (sub)command is also what is explained in the README\n- a heads-up that `identity` in the interactive bridge-adding process is just your username, and that you will be guided through optionally the auth key creation if you wish \n- generally, a full run through the detailed getting-started process of someone downloading and using git-bug for the first time\n\nI hope this is helpful, and please don't take it as criticism. My point is only that adding some more stuff in this direction may help with getting new users smoothly going without snags :)\n\nAnyways, have a good one ðŸ‘‹","files":null}]}
