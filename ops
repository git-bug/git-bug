First of all, this might be normal-ish, but every time I run more or less any git-bug command it shows:\n```\nA lock file is present but the corresponding process is not, removing it.\n```\nSecond, my new issues aren't registered properly. That is, if I create an issue it doesn't show up in the `git bug ls` command output, nor in the termui. However, if I push the bugs, they do show up in that list, and I can show their content if I run `git bug show` on the SHA.\n\nIt did manage to register one issue, my first one, and I can still interact with that bug by adding comments and labels, but no new bugs show up.\n\nOne thing that might be related is that all my bugs show up as having been added at the start of unix time (1970/01/01), not exactly sure what is happening. I installed git-bug by using the `go get` option, and here are some information that might be useful:\n```\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04.4\ngit: 2.7.4\ngo: 1.8.3\n```\nGit version is somewhat old, with might be the issue here. I can try to get a newer version and see if that helps. I ran an apt upgrade after adding the git PPA, but it somehow managed to mess up my system to the point of no return, so it is a bit hard to me to check. Sorry about that.","files":null}]}
