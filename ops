Another way would be to have a short alias to the `git-bug` binary. Another way would be to have a `git bug shell` command that would spawn a terminal where commands would be simply `title edit` and so on.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1537270552,"nonce":"SfoKoM6FScUH5dncSpvyvj0KUVQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjM1ODc4Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/2#issuecomment-422358783"},"message":"Alright, I made the \"safe\" changes, as detailed [above](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/2#issuecomment-419162351).\n\nThe missing parts are either completely new commands or things I'm unsure about.
