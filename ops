Github for example:\n- in `github/import.go` there is `ImportAll()`, the main loop, going over the events of `importMediator` (~300LOC). This component make the queries to browse the remote updates. It needs to be updated to also retrieve identity updates.\n- from the main loop, events are dispatched to a series of handler that will ensure that the change is replicated locally. Again, this need to be updated to also cover the identities updates. Here, \"the change is replicated\" means ensuring that there is a corresponding operation in git-bug for that change. This corresponding operation is tagged in its metadata with IDs from github, so that in the next run it's easy to check if this operation already exist.\n- eventually, the bridge importer should trigger `cache/RepoCache.Mutate()` to modify the identity. Looking at the code, this function should be complemented with a version that accept metadata, as this is for now missing.\n- when everything is said and done, don't forget to proudly update https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#importer-implementations\n\n\u003e Unrelated, but my git-fu is escaping me. Is there any way to commit `.git/git-bug`? Not even necessarily as part of a main code repository (I know there might be issues with that. Especially with the bridge configuration) but merely as a backup, so it can be hosted elsewhere in archival form.\n\nThere is no point in doing that. Everything there is cached data (for fast access, indexing..), built from the raw operation data. You can delete it and it we be rebuilt from zero. For the actual bug/identity data, you can just `push`/`pull`.\nThere is also:\n- some values in the git config (notably, the bridge config but no credentials)\n- the bridge credentials, stored in a file somewhere in your OS user data.","files":null}]}
