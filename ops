I'm using PowerShell7. This allowed me to create a first bug\n\n**(1)**\n```\nmkdir test_repo\ncd test_repo\ngit init\ntouch .gitignore\ngit add .\\.gitignore\ngit commit -m 'add: .gitginore'\ngit bug user new\n          ...CREATE THE USER...\ngit bug user adopt [HASH]\ngit bug termui\n          ...CREATE THE BUG...\n```\n\nI also tested with Git Bash and it worked.\n\nI also tried to create an empty repo and clone it in my machine, Then I did **(1)** but beginning in the line below git init, and I was able to create a first bug too. \n\nNow, about further bugs creations. I tried to add a file manually (test.txt) in both cases, then add, commit and create a bug. In the first case (local repo) I was able to create the second bug, but in the second case (empty cloned repo from github) I got the error. NOTE: I then tried this a second time and in both cases I was able to create the bug, I don't know what I did differently in the empty repo case\n\nI also tried to use New-Item in the local repo test, add, commit and create a third bug and this succeeded too.\n\nI really don't have much technical knowledge here, so that I cannot analyze this thoroughly, I even don't know if this is helpful, I hope it is.","files":null}]}
