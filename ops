Similarly if i had a url such as `ssb://xxxx` for scuttlebutt or `ipfs://xxxx` for ipfs, git-bug worked perfectly as a self-hosted git issue tracker for distributed networks.\n\nHowever after a certain update the alternative schemes are not longer supported. Pushing via \"git bug push\" will result in:\n```Error: unsupported scheme \"keybase\"```\n\nI would like to know if there's an interest in solving this and if anyone knows more info about it.
