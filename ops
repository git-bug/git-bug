I am just wondering at the feasability of something I would like to do: import a JSON file into a freshly-cloned repo and populate a `git-bug` issue tracker with that data (which would be exported by `git bug ls --format json`).

Because I use the issue tracker as a personal to-do list + notepad (and there are no other lightweight TUI programs (that I could find) that match the `git-bug` experience), if I was able to take that exported data and import it into a copy of the repo on another machine, then I would be able to use the awesome `git-bug` interface, with full portability, without any dependence on bridges which could break compatibility at any moment.\n\nI hope this idea makes sense.
