The code which you used is only a draft merge request. Anyway, for my own convenience I used a file `git-pug-import` to keep track of the progress. If that file is present, then the bridge will import only issues which are listed in that file. If you want to import all issues, then you should just delete the `git-bug-import` file. Then the bridge will import all issues and it will write a new file. Of course you can also write your own `git-bug-import` file. E.g., if you want to import issues 23, 45, and 65, you should create the file `git-bug-import` with the following content and start the import.\n\n```\n# file: git-bug-import\n23\n45\n65\n```\nThe bridge will update the file according to the import status. After the import the file might look as follows.\n```\n# file: git-bug-import\n# 23 # imported # Mon 01 Jan 07:03:25 2022\n# 45 # imported # Mon 01 Jan 07:03:42 2022\n65 # import error # Mon 01 Jan 07:03:56 2022\n```\nIf you would run the import again, it would read the file again and it would try only to import issue 65, which has failed in the previous import.\n\n\n\nThe other problems which you describe are probably not caused by the importer but some other component in git-bug.\n\n\n\nI would actually really appreciate input on how to improve the importer. My main headaches with the importer are (1) the fragility and changing error-behaviour of the GitHub GraphQL API, and (2) the user interface/interaction in case of errors during the import. How could we get closer to that really good importer?","files":null}]}
