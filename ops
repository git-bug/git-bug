In particular I pulled this repository (git-bug/git-bug) I expected to be able to see issues immediately in the master branch, however then I realized I'd need to perform `git bug pull origin`  - however no git bug issues are received at all - Is this repo not using git-bug? To me this is unexpected behaviour. I was able to setup a github bridge and then pull updates from github for the repo, however I thought the updates would be pushed directly into the git remote and that it would be possible to retrieve them without setting up the bridge for a repo that already has been using git-bug such as this repo (I assume). \n\nA little bit of clarity on workflow specifics would be useful, I also imagine that a few more commands in the `README.md` might be helpful, specific for those who want to access bugs in a repo which is already setup with git bug, maybe under the workflow diagrams. \n\nThanks for your time whoever reads this!","files":null}]}
