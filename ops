I suppose git-bug can't have default values as those are supposed to be secret. This means that a user wanting to have the webUI public **and** accept external auth would need to generate those secrets for each provider they want to have. Not ideal but that would work.\n\nIf we want to be fancy, would could have code that make the requests to generate those secrets (in a similar fashion as bridges generating tokens), but that's not necessary at all.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1668964392,"nonce":"P+6SK84z6xcBTvpvz+72P8wY4Sg=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOCGKeh84zgL6XzwAAAAHUAdjg"},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1668964392,"nonce":"gmZOeA1rOYcPvfvnamSy0W8TDKA=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOCGKeh84zgL6XzwAAAAHUAdji"},"added":["help wanted"],"removed":[]}]}
