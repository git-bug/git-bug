That's very likely a problem in https://github.com/go-git/gcfg.\n\nUnfortunately again, this project (part of go-git) is quite slow to progress. I have two PRs open there for a while.\n\nWe could switch to another library to edit the git config, but I don't know any. Or maintain a fork, but that's quickly annoying. Would you be able to fix that problem in `gcfg`?","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1677929564,"nonce":"O/cFKZaot3V2wpzZ/ZusWyTn2Mc=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOCGKeh85WtRZm","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/1022#issuecomment-1454708326"},"message":"Actually, maybe https://github.com/please-build/gcfg could do, it kinda seems like there is proper support for comments.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1677929606,"nonce":"4BYTUyo8vgz2xVaZ8br6q4MWPNg=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOCGKeh85WtRb3","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/1022#issuecomment-1454708471"},"message":"https://github.com/gravwell/gcfg also seem maintained.","files":null},{"type":6,"timestamp":1677929613,"nonce":"nq++piCnNP8LFclY6tEwyAZvDmM=","metadata":{"github-id":"UCE_lALOCGKeh85WtRb3zi4ahik"},"target":"b45df9fbad3e4eb68c87abdb7f15d4d59d7aa45c928482710e86098f8b172b73","message":"https://github.com/gravwell/gcfg also seems maintained.","files":null}]}
