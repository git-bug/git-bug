The idea is to delegate that to something that does it better. Let's not implement it ourselves, we would just do it terribly.\n\nFrom a UX point of view, I'm not considering to ask users to install a dependency (be it gnome-keyring,  systemd ...). \n\nOn the other hand, if there is a better option available to store credentials than a random file on disk, why not? But then, we quickly end in that situation: https://github.com/99designs/keyring/issues/74\n\nI suppose a better path would be to implement such cascading (and migrating?) support for multiple credential stores, with something like this priority order (from lower to higher prio):\n- encrypted file in user's home (as currently)\n- systemd (if go-keyring ever add support for it)\n- freedesktop's SecretService (would cover a lot of user)\n- git credentials (if we have a really secure way to do it)","files":null}]}
