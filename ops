But that should not be done really. `ls` is a command to list bugs and get an overview. You should only get the most important information, that is what is stored in the excerpt already. Displaying more details about a bug make more sense in the `show` command.\n\nNow, while org-mode make total sense to me as a way to export bugs to another format, I don't see the point of this markdown thing. What are we trying to solve here really? We need to answer that question properly to see if 1) it's worth it and 2) what and how this feature should really do. So  @karlicoss what's the point for you?","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1593126175,"nonce":"oRWYDjHSgxOiHkfcKYoJWsfeKB0=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTg1OTgyMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/392#issuecomment-649859822"},"message":"Resolved with https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/pull/410","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1593126175,"nonce":"E0L+GG+wrcnCTZsgdNR1Ao5gdvw=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ4NDQ0NzE3Mw=="},"status":2}]}
