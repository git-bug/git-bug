When I try to serve webui, it was nothing but 404 error.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\nI am using Arch distribution and using pre-compiled linux binary as I already mentioned. My first attempt was failure and I only had 404. Then I switched back to Windows and try serving webui from there, nothing was wrong. So I switched back to the linux and try to run webui as a `root` user. Checked the page, it was working.\n\nI also did check the netstat results\n```bash\n# when git-bug executed using `sudo`\nnetstat -tulnp | grep 3\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:37019         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      101685/./git-bug\n```\n\n```bash\n# when git-bug executed by normal user\n# port was `38313`\nnetstat -tulnp | grep 38\n# Nothing\n```\n\nI also able to serve without adding `sudo` in front of the git-bug couple of times but the rest of my attempts were just failures. So I highly doubt that binary is trying to use some /tmp/ folders but somewhat cannot create/read it. I don't know if it is relevant though.\n\n## Expected Behaviour\n\nWhen `git bug webui` executed in a project that uses git, web page should return 200 and should be visible.\n\n## Actual Behaviour\n\nWhen `git bug webui` executed by a normal user, serving web page went wrong. It couldn't get `enough` permissions (guessing here) to listen a port. However, using `sudo git bug webui` was working perfectly fine. Thus speculation about the permissions.\n\n---\n\nI also can dump more information if you guys tell me what else might be necessary.","files":null}]}
