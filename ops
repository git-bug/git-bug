A remote repo, even a newly created empty one, threw the error.\n\nWondering if it's running into an issue of Windows being more strict in what you can do with an open file. *nix allows you to rename an open file, Windows won't (this is one of the reasons Windows updates often require a full reboot). If that's the case, stepping through with a debugger and checking what has the file open (stale file handle waiting to be GC'd?) might give a hint even on a non-Windows install.\n\n(thanks all for looking into this, I know what a pain it is debugging on a system you don't use)","files":null}]}
