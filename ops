The issue that was brought up -- outdated documentation -- will be tracked in #1209. To the remaining questions...\n\n\u003e The docu mentions git bug ls, but is seems not to exist anymore. Is there an other way to list issues?\n\nIf you've built from HEAD, `ls` was moved under a `bug` subcommand, so (_somewhat awkwardly_), you need to type `git-bug bug`. `git bug ls` is still appropriate if you're using `v0.8.0`.\n\n---\n\n\u003e what is the difference between `git bug push` and `git bug bridge push` (and same for `pull`)? I know it, but purely from CLI help messages, I could not deduce it.\n\n`git-bug-push` and `git-bug-pull` interact with `refs/bugs` namespace on the remote -- pushing and pulling like you to a branch under the `refs/heads` namespace.\n\n`git-bug-bridge-push` and `git-bug-bridge-pull` interact with the bridge's API, and could more aptly be described as \"import to git-bug\" and \"export from git-bug\" operations. I agree that this experience can be improved. One thought I have is to make bridge operations transparent (#1223), but we could also provide better clarification via documentation and helptext.\n\n---\n\n\u003e It is `git bug help` but `git bug bridge --help`\n\nThanks for bringing this inconsistency up.","files":null}]}
