Here is a sample of questions that I have:\n\n## Actor\n\n- what properties (name, email, login, id, avatar ...) does the bug-tracker know about an actor ?\n- what is mandatory, what is optional ?\n\n## Bug's state\n\n- how do they model a state ? Is it an fixed set of state, or is it extensible? configurable ?\n- how do they model the transition between these states ?\n\n## missing features in git-bug\n\n- For instance, Github support reactions to messages with a set of emojis. What other bug-tracker support that ?\n- What other important features other bug-trackers have ? Is there a common ground ? Are they incompatible ?\n\nWith the attention git-bug got lately, hopefully we can collaborate and fill the blanks together in a shared spreadsheet.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1534943004,"nonce":"/XGMfwyr+FmJ6vmV2M9K1KO4424=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MDI1OTAyMTc="},"added":["help wanted"],"removed":[]}]}
