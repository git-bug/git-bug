To do that, we need a pre-computed index of words to keep a reasonable performance.\n\nSuch index *could* store the number of occurrence of a word within a bug. Ideally it would filter the most common words. Possibly, this index would be common to all bugs. Also, this index needs to support updating when a new operation is added.","files":null}]}
