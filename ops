This would allow to instantly search in issues within the IDE without having to switch to the terminal/web UI.\n\nPreviously I was using [org-sync](https://github.com/arbox/org-sync) for this, but just discovered `git bug`, and it seems way more mature and reasonable :)\n\nFormat is not super important, IMO just merely having it as text gives you 90% of the benefits regardless the format, but:\n- markdown would be easier to support natively since github uses it\n- org-mode is kinda nice because you can use map github's tags and states (open/closed). \n\nPossible future improvements:\n- dump plaintext automatically on `git bug bridge pull`\n- allow two way sync, i.e. modifying comments, adding new issues by adding new entries to text files... but that seems hard and maybe not worth it\n\nPossibly related to:\n- https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/12\n- https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/342\n\nLet me know if you think it makes sense, and if you have any thoughts on possible implementation, I would be happy to contribute. And thanks for this awesome tool :)","files":null}]}
