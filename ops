You need to do it once and then it‘s done. It‘s not like your changing your makefile every release but if you are you are doing something very wrong.\n\n\u003e also this webserver/ui combo is awesome: just run the command, and the ui is already there. no need to install lighttpd for example (which is required for git instaweb btw) and no need to spend time configuring anything.\n\nThank you for making this example! Git itself separated git and git-web, so you actually made a point against your own opinion.\n\n\u003e @Anachron i personally like to see the issues of a project in my web browser, i dont wanna do that inside my terminal, i can say that \"i dont need a termui to use git-bug, so I dont see why it should be shipped by default. there are tons of people who will only use the web part\"? it seems to me that you dont want a web server just because you dont use it.\n\nAgain I can hardly understand your reasoning. This tool comes with optional webserver (default passive) already so it already shows webui is just a secondary ui. If we make a survey I am pretty sure most people will do terminal-ui only instead of web-ui. \n\nThis integrated webserver stuff seems popular in Go. I‘ve found several cool projects which dont need one but include it „because it doesn‘t take much“. I am not a fan of every new software I get to have a standalone webserver that I cant maintain and/or configure/harden etc.","files":null}]}
