Specifically, go-git has long-standing issues with not respecting `~/.ssh/config`. For example, this one from their old repo: [src-d/go-git#1220](https://github.com/src-d/go-git/issues/1220). There are also similar unresolved issues in the newer [go-git/go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) repo — but most of them have gone stale.\n\nGiven that there's little hope `go-git` will support parsing `~/.ssh/config` anytime soon, would it be possible for `git-bug` to offer an option to use the system `git` binary for remote interactions (e.g., as a build-time option or fallback)?\n\nThat would solve this kind of issue without waiting on upstream `go-git` changes.","files":null}]}
