In that scenario, the initial identity creation happen [there](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/5511c230b678a181cc596238bf6669428d1b1902/bridge/core/config.go#L10-L46), at the end of the bridge configuration process. We could add a prompt for the avatar URL, but frankly it would be just clunky and barely solve anything.\n\u003e \n\u003e What's really missing is that the bridge is not updating the identities. It's definitely doable but nobody has done it yet.\n\u003e \n\u003e Another piece missing is a CLI command to update identities details.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you'd like to give it a shot, I could give you some hints.\n\nI dunno if I'll have the time any time soon (I'm currently working on my own OS, a web framework for my day job, an alternative to man pages, and a Go based implementation of OpenBSD's/SerenityOS' `pledge(2)`) but I can certainly give it a try. Especially if you can give hints.\n\nUnrelated, but my git-fu is escaping me. Is there any way to commit `.git/git-bug`? Not even necessarily as part of a main code repository (I know there might be issues with that. Especially with the bridge configuration) but merely as a backup, so it can be hosted elsewhere in archival form.","files":null}]}
