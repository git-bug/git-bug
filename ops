This has its pros and cons. Main con is that it exposes these files and their changes to the users. Some pros are: being able to pinpoint issue state, being able to affect issue(s) from within patches, easing transition between version control tools, etc.\n\nI believe that issues can't be \"global\" -- their content and state always have a context. That's why the design choice to make this data live alongside with the primary content was made. \n\nFrom what I remember, I don't remember any decentralized (and merge-conflict-free) issue tracker do anything similar. Though I might have missed some.","files":null}]}
