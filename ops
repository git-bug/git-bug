Normally when I do `git pull` it brings stuff to my local laptop from the remote git (typically github or gitlab), why wouldn't `git bug pull` do the same for the issues i.e. I can't understand what `git-bug pull` would do that is different from `git bug bridge pull` ?\n\nP.S. I suggest re-opening the issue, as a UX issue if its not a bug !","files":null}]}
