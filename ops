I guess having a `CloseAndCommentBug` mutation and avoiding entirely the multi-mutations requests make sense. If you want to do that you'll have to:\n1. update the graphQL schema files and add the mutation: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/api/graphql/schema/mutations.graphql\n2. regenerate the go code of the graphQL server: either through go generate (https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/api/graphql/handler.go#L1) or run `go run gen_graphql.go`\n3. implement the mutation (https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/api/graphql/resolvers/mutation.go)\n\nThis should be not too difficult as you have examples of very similar code.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1614165184,"nonce":"W8NQ8BmhWdkV3/PJz1BBeEC+sP0=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTAwMjE3MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/553#issuecomment-785002170"},"message":"Actually a better name would be `commentAndCloseBug`.","files":null}]}
