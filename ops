So let's say I'm offline and I would like to look up https://github.com/author/myproject/issues/6, then that would be possible. Perhaps something like:\n\n```\ngit bug ls --metadata github-url=https://github.com/author/myproject/issues/6\n```\n\ncould list all matching bugs, typically just one.","files":null}]}
