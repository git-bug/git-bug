According to me a bug needs to be delted from three different components of our software:\n1) The Bug cache...\n2) The local refs folder\n3) The Bug Excerpt Cache(I guess this populates itself from point 1)\nSo The way I thought of appraching this would be create a function to remove an entry from the caches and one function to remove the same from the corresponding local refs folder.\nIs this apporach correct or do you have different views?","files":null}]}
