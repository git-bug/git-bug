This query language is heavily inspired by the [Github one](https://help.github.com/en/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax). In [this document](https://help.github.com/en/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax#exclude-certain-results) they mention that you can prefix a term with a `-` to invert it's meaning.\n\nSo with you example, the plain-text query command would be `git bug ls -label:foo`. Problem is, this definitely looks like a command line flags, right ? That will confuse the CLI parser and potentially users as well. Maybe we could use `~` instead (used as \"not\" in logic notation)? Not sure that's less confusing though, as it looks very similar. Any better idea ?\n\nUsing the capital letter for the shorthand to invert the filter would works great though. For the long flags, maybe we can prefix them with `not-` ? So we would have `--not-label foo` or `--not-status open`.\n\nThoughts ?","files":null}]}
