The `default` value of `OutputFormat` produces the following output (only one bug shown):\n\n```\n7daec5d open\\tthis is a bug title                               \\tJohn Doe       \\t\\n\n```\n\nThis output is almost TSV compatible but would require that the space following the hash prefix be replaced by a tab.  For a human, any shell with a tab size of 2, 4 or 8 characters would still result in the output being displayed with a single space after when viewed.  It would however make machine processing of the output much simpler.\n\nThis issue would involve analyzing (and updating where needed) the following `OutputFormat`s:\n\n- [ ] org-mode\n- [ ] plain\n- [ ] json\n- [ ] compact\n- [ ] default","files":null}]}
