I am just wondering at the feasability of something I would like to do: import a JSON file into a freshly-cloned and populate a `git-bug` issue tracker with that data (which would be exported by `git bug ls --format json`). Sort of like a bridge, but with JSON instead of a specific git provider.\n\nThe background is that I've been having trouble with the bridges, both GitLab (I've tried the dev branch, still having issues), and GitHub (this one I should probably troubleshoot more).\n\nUltimately, what it comes down to is that I really like the `git-bug` interface, but my issues in dealing with the bridges led me to the realization that `git-bug` allows you to export the data as JSON. Because I use the issue tracker as a personal to-do list + notepad (and there are no other lightweight TUI programs (that I could find) that match the `git-bug` experience), if I was able to take that exported data and import it into a copy of the repo on another machine, then I would be able to use the awesome `git-bug` interface, with full portability, without any dependence on bridges which could break compatibility at any moment.\n\nI hope this idea makes sense. More importantly, I hope it could be implemented without too much effort.\n\nThanks","files":null}]}
