The problem is that I have closed a few bugs from the command line using `git bug status close \u003cid\u003e`. After that, I started the termui, but it is displaying those bugs as \"open\". I'm using a filter `status:open label:json`. However, when I press enter to show details of that bug, it says \"closed\". Furthermore, when I go back to the list (press \"q\") that bug is no longer in the open list. I took a screencast:\n\n![termui_stale](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309820/67522325-6b104600-f661-11e9-8e63-7a32dba65e94.gif)\n\nIn the screencast note bugs `12fc493` and `71ac52e` at the bottom of the list. They are both listed as \"open\". Then I press \"enter\" to view the status. Note it says \"closed\". Then I press \"q\" and go back to the list. Note that the bug has disappeared from the list. \n\nThis is observed on `master` from today. I deleted that and went back to the prebuilt binary from `v0.5.0` so I will update if the problem seems to go away or persists. \n\nI will note that these labels were possibly assigned \"near\" a termui crash (#233) so that *might* be related.","files":null}]}
