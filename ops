Thank you!\n\nIt also looks like labels are being synced now... kinda. I say kinda because pulling labels from issues in GitLab seems to be hit or miss. Some issues locally will show labels added in GitLab, some won't. As an example, I had added some labels locally to issues that had labels in GitLab when they didn't get pulled initially (ie. before using the `fix-gitlab` branch). When i pushed to GitLab using the `fix-gitlab` branch, the local labels overwrote the remote labels completely, so I went and added the original labels back in GitLab. I then pulled from GitLab and only some of the original labels I added back got pulled. For other issues in GitLab that have labels already, they're not getting pulled down.\n\nAlso, I think the GitLab bridge is pulling deleted comments. I had a few comments locally that got pushed when I tried the `fix-gitlab` branch that I then deleted in GitLab since I had added them there too when they weren't pushed previously. I then pulled from GitLab and the deleted comments were pulled, meaning I now have two identical comments locally. This likely constitutes a separate issue.","files":null}]}
