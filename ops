You could easily write a bridge-plugin that synchronizes git-bug with a TaskWarrior database or Google Calender, for example.\n* Also plugins can be implemented in any language you like.\n\n\u003e [...] would be a massive effort, with little benefit.\n\u003e This is because  the interfacing required between the bridges and git-bug core is massive\n\nThat is true. Simply translating existing interface into an API would not bring much value. To make this thing rock, we'd have to export only the minimum needed for the bridges to operate.  \nIf there's a good minimum, I am not sure. I would love to do some experiments, though.","files":null}]}
