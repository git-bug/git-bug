It says to add a bridge with \n\n```\ngit bug bridge new\n```\n\nhowever, that yields:\n\n```\nError: unknown command \"new\" for \"git-bug bridge\"\n```\n\nUsing the `--help` option, it appears that the correct sub-command is `configure`, and indeed, that works. I'd started a pull request fixing the README, but I thought maybe this a discrepancy between the state of the code and the release, so I figured I tell you here \n\nCheerz, and cool project :)","files":null}]}
