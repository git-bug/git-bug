It also aligns well with git's metaphors for \"branches\" and \"trees\" -- `trunk` feels semantically aligned and descriptive of it being the primary/core development line.\n\nIt also helps to emphasize a \"trunk-based development\" workflow, where branches are short-lived and the aim is to commit to trunk frequently. See trunkbaseddevelopment.com for more information about TBD.\n\n## What actions do I need to take?\n\nIf you have cloned this repository, you'll need to take a few actions in your local copy in order to change the default branch.\n\n### 1. Rename your local default branch\n\n```\ngit branch -m master trunk\n```\n\n### 2. Set the new default for `origin/HEAD`\n\n```\ngit remote set-head origin -a\n```\n\n\u003e **NOTE**\n\u003e If you have a different remote name for this git repository, be sure to change that, instead of `origin`.\n\n### 3. Update any scripts or references to the old default branch\n\nBe sure to update any scripts, packages, or other references to the old default branch name.","files":null}]}
