It is not mentioned in the documentation that it will be the case\n2. Maybe it's because of something I did? Is the author always ' \u003c\u003e' ? Is there any reason ?\n3. It's easy to hide them with the following command `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph  --perl-regexp --author='^((?! \u003c\u003e).*)$'`\n4. Maybe we should add some information about this in the documentation.\n\nI'd be glad to write a pull request, but I'm not sure where to document this or even if it's necessary. But I thought it was missing.","files":null}]}
