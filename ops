Few things from my perspective:\n\n- might be nice to have status in the heading for a quick overview?\n- instead of `login:` could use clickable links instead?\n- not sure if the ids are worth including in the markdown, can they even be reached through github's interface? Also human id seems to be a prefix of id, so not sure if worth keeping?","files":null}]}
