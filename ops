So with about 200 items now in my bug list, the biggest problem for me is the ability to focus. I tag all my entries with the appropriate categories, and I currently filter on the fly, but as I add more categories of issues, the list of filters I need to apply to every command is getting unwieldy. \n\nI'd like to be able to run something like: `git-bug focus ui crash` and have `-l ui -l crash` automatically applied to all future `ls` commands.\n\n(Similarly, I'd also like to be able to run `git-bug ignore deferred` and have all entries with the \"deferred\" tag omitted from future listings. But that raises the question of boolean logic for filters and should be a separate issue report.)","files":null}]}
