Being designed around a simpler primitive of a file set (instead of depending on Git or any other system), it's all just files, potentially checked into a repo. Once they are checked in, they are branched at will and there are no merge conflicts because all files are considered immutable.\n\nI personally find this to be a very useful feature for back-porting, distinguishing between production/master and particularly pinpointing the state of an issue to any revision (\"how did it look *exactly* here?\", \"is this fixed on 1.0 branch?\", etc.)","files":null}]}
