We can leverage this and encrypt the bug operations with a multi-reader crypto scheme to limit who can read the bug. \n\nhttps://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/12431 give insight about what such crypto scheme might looks like.\n\nSome things to keep in mind though:\n- user key revocation/rotation\n- we might need to store independently from the bugs the groups information (symmetric key K to encrypt the data, K encrypted for each user keys). Bug data is immutable so if we want to give access to someone else, it's not possible if everything is in the encrypted OperationPack.\n- what happen if a user key is leaked ?\n\nIt doesn't even have to be the whole bug, it can also be just a comment. If an operation is encrypted, it becomes a no-op for users that can't decrypt it, and it still works for them.","files":null}]}
