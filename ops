I agree that it's still readable but I also find the extra separating space visually relaxing. Maybe a good compromise would be to remove only the top spacing ? What do I know, I'm no designer ;)\n\n\u003e I find the bug table view quite convenient when scanning for issues compared to regular ls (with the cycle: search/narrow/examine/repeat).\n\nYeah that's the idea. The low level CLI commands are really meant for scripting and integration into other tools.\n\n\u003e \"COMMENTS\" still takes a lot of space IMHO, which I'd shorten to CMT\n\nI could see that happening. Is CMT a common way to abbreviate comment though? I'm not native.\n\nThere is also a bug in this column: when no extra comment has been made on a bug after the creation, `0 ðŸ’¬` should be displayed there, or even nothing.\n\n\u003e with \"LAST EDIT\" (which seems always \"a long while ago\" for some reason)\n\nthis is due to https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/426","files":null}]}
