There are tons of people who will use the cli only part.\n\n@Anachron i personally like to see the issues of a project in my web browser, i dont wanna do that inside my terminal, i can say that \"*i dont need a termui to use git-bug, so I dont see why it should be shipped by default. there are tons of people who will only use the web part*\"? it seems to me that you dont want a web server **just** because you dont use it.\n\nalso this webserver/ui combo is awesome: just run the command, and the ui is already there. no need to install lighttpd for example (which is required for `git instaweb` btw) and no need to spend time configuring anything.\n\n@MichaelMure keep the webserver, it doesnt hurt anyone, saves time by not having to install anything to get the webui working, and people who like to use their web browser to comment issues will be happy. terminal people can still use the terminal ui, and they will be happy too. win win for everyone.","files":null}]}
