Currently, git-bug only support editing a comment with a special Operation. It's possible to extend that system (\"delete comment\" seems to be the more probable) but it doesn't seems to be important to me, even to support importing from external bug tracker.\n- having a way to edit the pending history is a different thing and would be helpful to give more control to the user. I'm noting this this sort of staging area for bug edition doesn't exist anywhere else. Not sure if that's a plus or a minus.\n- there is two different concepts here: \"undo\" and \"delete\". It seems to me that it should be one or the other, not both to not overwhelm the UI/UX.\n- \"undo\" is easy to understand and implement but can't alter something deep in the stack without being destructive\n- \"delete\" doesn't have that limitation but also imply a trickier implementation because you can't delete everything: what happen if you delete the creation of a comment when there is a comment edition later ? In the future we will likely have more dependency like this.\n\nFrom a technical perspective:\n- unless it's \"making the status change slightly more difficult\", all of those solutions imply deeper control over those pending operation, possibly the notion of transaction as well. That would probably be a good thing to have but it's also quite a big piece of work and won't happen quickly.","files":null}]}
