I trained many people to use Git and indeed merging state is a huge barrier to learn a ton of concepts and techniques, and then even when you master them it still takes time.\n\nFor state such as status, title, labels or assignee this it is indeed trivial to recover any merge that gone wrong. Initially I thought there would be a problem with merging comment edits.\n\nTo clarify my use case, I use comment editing a lot. Sometimes I have \"long running\" issues where multiple users make multiple edits to the description to accumulate enough information (and it can grow into a large piece of text). Other case is when a contributor makes a very good comment I can edit it to improve structure and fix typos, because that comment can potentially be a good reference for years.\n\nI guess that as you noted, low frequencey of events and small number of people doing edits (often one) applies to comment editing as well. And if participants coordinate through a centrally hosted repository they would do their best to push early, just like we do with Git. Even better if it is possible to discard or adjust local changes after pull to avoid spawning edits that correct your previous edits done before the pull.\n\nSome background - my initial research was to find incremental GitHub issue backup/archival tool that can grab all new comments and edits as simple as `git fetch`. I was very excited to read the v0.4.0 release with incremental github importer that also supported comment edits. With potential exporter, an offline client for GitHub issues with full local data copy is much cooler than just data backup, and allows less use of browsers.\n\nThanks for answers! I think this can be closed now.","files":null}]}
