This makes it impossible to keep bugs from different sources separate.\n\nUse cases can be: \n* public and private bug trackers.\n* pulling and pushing bugs from multiple forks while keeping them separate.\n\nWhen it comes to namespacing references, the usual solution in git is to just make a path based namespace scheme. So using something like `.git/refs/bugs/default/\u003coid\u003e` would be the easiest solution to allow the use of other namespaces, e.g. `.git/refs/bugs/private/\u003coid\u003e`\n\nAnother possible candidate is gitnamespaces as in https://git-scm.com/docs/gitnamespaces.\n\nAnd of course, something would need to be done about the global state stored on `.git/git-bug`.\n\nThoughts?","files":null}]}
