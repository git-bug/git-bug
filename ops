Apparently, creating a first bug using WSL \"unlocks\" the creation of bugs the normal way. These are the details:\n\nI installed WSL and the archlinux distro. I installed git-bug manually with AUR (I did a fix stated in the comments [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-bug-bin) to be able to install it). I cloned my project repo from GitHub into the archlinux filesystem, tried to create a bug and it succeeded.\n\nI also tried to create a bug directly in the cloned version of my repo in the windows filesystem, where I always work, and this succeeded too. I used WSL here.\n\nThen I tried to create a bug using Git Bash and PowerShell7 directly and it worked.\n\nI created a few more bugs and they were created without problems.\n\nI tried both termui and webui.\n\nI'm still getting this error...\n`[6516:0511/232729.476:ERROR:service_worker_storage.cc(2072)] Failed to delete the database: Database IO error`\n...so that I think that this is not related to the issue. Probably this is due to some \"tweaks\" I was doing in my machine.\n\nI didn't do further tests because I really don't now how to use this tool properly. If you want me to make some specific tests I could try to do it.","files":null}]}
