I opened .git/config, and copy\u0026pasted the entry, editing the owner field accordingly; that seems to work somewhat, though when I push to this bridge, it pushed 0 issues (and there are no issues in the github UI), even though I have 54 open issues locally.\n3. what is the difference between `git bug push` and `git bug bridge push` (and same for `pull`)?

It is `git bug help` but `git bug bridge --help`","files":null}]}
