The problem is that the gitlab API changed and we don't have access to the history of state change anymore. See https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/bridge/gitlab/export_test.go#L245-L248\n\nTo be fair, it's not even a proper API. They call that \"note\", it's a sort of stream of untyped events. It was sort of enough at some point to get the full history of a bug but not anymore.\n\nhttps://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/bridge/gitlab/import_notes.go\n\nOne thing we could do is to create a status change in git-bug to match the *final state*, but that means we won't have the full history.\n\n\u003e modified bugs are not exported.\n\nNo idea about this one.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1612805261,"nonce":"Ppl3BQPAAIiQTXJESiPATNDh4fE=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTMxMTY3NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/366#issuecomment-775311675"},"message":"Well, that was 7 months ago, maybe the API changed again?","files":null}]}
