It's correct but misleading. It's a go array ... in memory. On disk, it's a serialized JSON.\n\n\u003e With this question I was meaning to ask, why not store each Operation as a Blob, and have the OperationsPack be a Tree of these Blobs?\n\nPerformance and storage. Less git object means less work to store them or move them around in the network. Having one operation per Blob would lead to a lot of tiny objects. Having OperationPack to group them reduce that. Also, when commit signature is implemented, a single signature will be necessary instead of one per operation.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1570962311,"nonce":"5QO4dDv1RFxgT4q6hMIXIg2th1g=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTQwNjAxOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/227#issuecomment-541406019"},"message":"Your solution would work as well, it's just a tradeoff.","files":null}]}
