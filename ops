I had been placing this ID in my commits to easily reference the issue if needed.\n\nHowever, I have noticed that each time I clone the repo and pull from a bridge, the issues are given a new set of hashes/IDs. This means that I cannot reference an issue using this method. (Of course, I may just be doing something wrong.)\n\nHere is my question: **Is there a best practice for referencing bugs by some sort of ID number, so that commits and issues can reference each other? (preferably one that is not tied to an issue tracker ID# on an existing bridge)**\n\nIs there a way to do this entirely within `git-bug` without relying on the implementation details of a specific bridge (e.g. GitHub issue IDs)? Relying on the bridge may be problematic (e.g. GitHub issues can be deleted, creating Issue # gaps that may pose a problem if the issue tracker is ported to another bridge... issue numbers would likely be desynchronized).\n\nFor now, I'll probably just generate a short random value to reference between both, but I'm curious what other people are doing (or if I'm doing something wrong :D).\n\nThanks","files":null}]}
