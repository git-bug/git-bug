They just landed a complete rewrite of this, so it's possible there is a bug lurking somewhere. The code generating the file is there: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/zsh_completions.go\n\nAs for the custom completion of bug ID, it seems that Cobra doesn't support that at the moment for ZSH: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/zsh_completions.md\n\nThat said, it's very much in line with what they want to support (it's possible for bash). git-bug has the `ls-id` command so it would be pretty easy to plug there. Note though that all te git-bug commands support giving a simple prefix, so you don't need that much the completion.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1565779742,"nonce":"XcB+54ig5DSwYLH/W8RJgVYMrgM=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTE5NzI2MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/38#issuecomment-521197261"},"message":"The bracket problem is fixed with this PR upstream: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/899","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1668961637,"nonce":"hMRqiNooMZ863iJRbE5aNWTIq0I=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOCGKeh85Ov4Y3","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/38#issuecomment-1321174583"},"message":"This has been working for long.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1668961638,"nonce":"RF5FqKRDeChFoa+vWGDYaqBUy7w=","metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOCGKeh84VRb0QzwAAAAHUAMZh"},"status":2}]}
