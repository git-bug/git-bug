This makes sense.\n\nI currently use git bug as my private issue tracker. Local, only accessible to me—great. But the issues might be of interest to others. Letting them import them under a separate namespace would be nice.\n\n(If that would also help against merge conflicts, that would be great. I have no idea though since I don’t know how git bug is implemented.)\n\nI also don’t want to use SHA-1 for bug ids. git bug probably probably doesn’t support incrementing ids so I’ll probably just do it manually. Then with my namespace the issues could be identified with `\u003cnamespace\u003e-\u003cinteger\u003e`.","files":null}]}
