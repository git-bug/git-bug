The problem is that there is a conversion missing.\n\nEditCommentOperation correctly use an Operation's Id as the target. The problem is that the termui (and webUI I suppose) is using a comment's ID (a combined ID) directly without conversion. Where exactly this conversion should happen, I'm not so sure.\n\nAlso, having a different type (`entity.CombinedId`) might make sense to avoid those class of bugs. We would know what kind of Id we have and the compiler could enforce the correct usage.","files":null}]}
