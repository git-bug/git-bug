So something like `git-bug webui -q status:closed` could influence what URL is opened once the webserver is up \u0026 running.\n\n\u003e Could You please tell a little bit more about the use case You have?\n\nMy use-case is when I have a git checkout for a project cloned from github, then I use the git-bug bridge to also download the issues. Now when a commit message or comment refers to an issue with its full URL, then I can look up the details of that issue nicely, offline. But getting there is a bit annoying, I have to manually search for `metadata:github-url:\"https://github.com/author/project/issues/42\"`. It is much more handy if I can fire up the webui in a way that it opens the relevant issue out of the box. More or less a follow-up to https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/567.","files":null}]}
