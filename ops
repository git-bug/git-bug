The main problem with this technique is that you need to create the identity on only one machine and copy it to the other machines.  Ultimately, you're also going to want one identity even across repositories too (like you have at GitHub.)  Perhaps a DID?\n\nExcept for sharing between machines, I can envision other reasons for what amounts to a JSON bridge!","files":null}]}
