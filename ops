When you imported from github, you created new bugs *after* the first one.\n\nI'm all for improving the documentation but I'm not sure how to document those kind of small oddities without flooding the important message in details. I'm open to suggestions.\n\n\u003e I posted briefly in the gitter about it this week, but have not seen a response there yet.\n\nSorry about that :-| Gitter is a little weird and it happen often that I just don't get any notifications.\n\nClosing as it's not an actual bug.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1603393675,"nonce":"8S6uiaABB7XD0BQSZK9+bPJ/oYs=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkxMDcxMTYxMw=="},"status":2}]}
