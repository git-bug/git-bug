It is now relatively popular and I would like to promote it to a real Github organization to grow a community and regroup the various related repository.\n\nThe obvious `git-bug` name is taken by your account that you haven't used in years now. Would you consider releasing this name? That would be very nice of you. It's not much but I can send you some stickers of this project in exchange.\n\nCould you contact me at batolettre@gmail.com ?","files":null}]}
