I'm using ayu_dark theme (which I love).\n\nI also tried other themes. Some are almost unreadable like _catppuccin_frappe_ or _acme_, and others are okay like _vscode_ or _xterm_.\n\nMaybe you can solve this at your end? I understand that this has much to do with how the corresponding theme handles colors, but I think that having light colors for both background and characters is not going to work for most custom themes, unless they have some emphasis in high contrast.\n\nMaybe you could drop the background and put a bar above the commands instead of highlighting the commands with a light color, or maybe you could use a dark color for the characters of commands (white background and black characters, so that the commands stand out but are readable).\n\nNOTE: I don't see guidelines about how to format issues to that I just wrote this as I saw fit.","files":null}]}
