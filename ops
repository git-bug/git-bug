A milestone describes a bigger task, which requires\nmultiple issues to be resolved, possible in a given set of time.\nThis means, a milestone may have a deadline in which all the Issues\nmay be completed. The deadline shall currently have no effect on the milestone\nand simply provide a hint.\n\n- Add a description to a milestone.\n- Add Issues to an existing milestone. This may be done by using special\n\"milestone-\u003cname\u003e\" labels. The user should then be able to see all current\nmilestones within a new menu. The milestones shall have a completion-value,\nwhich will be a percentage determined by all associated issues and their\nopen/close-state.  This means a milestone should be 100% complete, if all\nassigned Issues are closed.\n\nLike Issues, milestones may be active or closed as needed.\nNOTE: Maybe milestones can be implemented as Issues, with only some fanzy UI\nvariation (progressbar). Could extend go code to add milestones as composite of the composite-pattern","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1619023777,"nonce":"kXti722u4Kp34yyJo1GeUq9oI2M=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDIwODc2Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/639#issuecomment-824208766"},"message":"As you noticed, milestones and labels are conceptually very close. That said, they should *probably* have their own operation in git-bug's core instead of piggy-backing on the labels.
