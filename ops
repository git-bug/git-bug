Besides starting a SSH Agent `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` and adding the key `ssh-add ~/.ssh/mykey`, I had to use a full URL (`ssh://user@server.org:22/path/to/project.git`) in the git remote. Only this got `git bug push/pull` working. This workaround was reported by @Subfortytwo at #572.\nIt seems like the SSH Agent does not read my `~/.ssh/config`?\n\nAnyway, I am on the same page as @NobbZ: I would rather avoid using a SSH Agent. Is that possible? It wasn't needed last time I used git-bug (a couple years ago).","files":null}]}
