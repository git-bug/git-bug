What OS are you running and when you say that you start `git-bug` but don't close it, do you mean `termui` or `webui` (running the `git-bug` CLI should stop on it's own and delete the lock file).\n\nI'm runnig Linux (6.1.12-arch1-1), using `termui`. I understand your comment about that \"crazy path to a bug\": first time I reported this issue, my computer has halted with a power breakdown. I suppose it can be a \"real case\", so hardrebooted to try reproduce and reporting it as an issue.","files":null}]}
