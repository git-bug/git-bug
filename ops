Not so much in a CLI interface.\n\nIt would be neat to have a common query format for all UIs though.\n\nI'm inclined to go for the first option as the termui will give the \"easy to use UI\" in a terminal, leaving the CLI for automated interaction or simple manual tasks.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1536331158,"nonce":"gpHOrlQsE7K3rmo6g+fAKje0c0I=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTQ2MDQzOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/21#issuecomment-419460439"},"message":"Also, a micro language can be added later.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1536524419,"nonce":"gU/3o7mNdFTSVVVhhjzhQECBDdA=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTc0MjIyMw==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/21#issuecomment-419742223"},"message":"I had a burst of motivation and implemented a micro query DSL for filtering/sorting.\n\n[Documentation](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/doc/queries.md)\n\nIt's already available in `git bug ls`, minus a parsing bug with quoted qualifer (`label:\"Good first issue\"`).","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1536596535,"nonce":"EMefKe1CrJD9sIzkaq2jvfrCDcs=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTk3MzM0NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug/issues/21#issuecomment-419973345"},"message":"`git bug ls` now support expressing a query with both the DSL and regular flags:\n\n## git-bug ls\n\nList bugs\n\n### Synopsis\n\nDisplay a summary of each bugs.\n\nYou can pass an additional query to filter and order the list.
