From what I've seen, it's also a very common question/need, especially for newcomers.\n\nI'm not so sure about the naming though, `eject`? `cleanup`? It doesn't fully feels right.\n\nNow for the design:\n- in [`entity_actions.go`](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/5511c230b678a181cc596238bf6669428d1b1902/entity/dag/entity_actions.go) there is already a `Remove()`, we can have a `RemoveAll()`\n- bubbling that up in `entities/bug/bug_actions.go`, the equivalent `RemoveAll()`\n- for identities, they don't rely on the \"entity framework\", so more code need to be added in `entities/identity/identity_actions.go`\n- to finish, a new command using `LoadRepo()` instead of `LoadBackend()` to bypass the cache and directly run the previous functions\n\nLet me know if that make sense.","files":null}]}
