However, I get an error with the script on master.\nI might take a look. One problem is that `-` is not valid in fish's variable names. Probably an easy fix in Cobra.\n\n```\nset: Variable name '__git-bug_comp_do_file_comp' is not valid.

Then completions for `git bug ` should also work (assuming the other error is fixed). Also then there is no need to manually `source` it, it will be when the user types `git bug`.","files":null}]}
