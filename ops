I was looking into this and thought it would be great to integrate one of my repos with an Epic that is in my team's Jira Project.  However, I don't see a way to filter or import a subset of a project.  Our team maintains a dozen different repositories, so `git bug bridge pull` would be pretty excessive to sync our thousands of Jira tickets for each repo.\n\nIs there an idea or a PR or docs behind how you could do partial import/export syncing in Jira to just tickets under an epic?  I was thinking the simplest would be just some kind of interface to JQL, but it looks like [it's hard-coded](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/55e4046b4bb77139e25ee6ad7adcfc829d4e6ba5/bridge/jira/import.go#L93-L94) and I'm not sure if that's the only place that this is happening or if there's some other config that I am missing.","files":null}]}
