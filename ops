For Reference see: https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/516.\n\nWhile go-git seems to already have merged a fix for this issue ([see this comment](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/516#issuecomment-1455038678)), git-bug could still have this issue in its latest released version, because the fix was introduced shortly after the latest release of git-bug.\n\nDate of latest git-bug release (v.0.8.0): Nov 20, 2022\nCreation date of possible fix within go-git repo: Nov 25, 2022\n\nBut this is only a guess. ;-)","files":null}]}
