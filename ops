Personally, I would prefer something more modular. [Here is a python program][1] I'm using to close bugs based on commit messages. I supposed one could add it as a post-merge to do this automatically which would complete the integration I think. I choose to do this manually for now.\n\nThe program assumes a rebase workflow, so you might need to adapt it if you use a merge workflow. \n\nExample commit message:\n```\n    [json] Delete old streaming API, cleanup some of the new code\n    \n    * Use SerializeOpts inside StreamDumper to pretty-print (ish)\n    * convert json_gen to generate code for the new registry-based\n      streaming API and update stream_gen_test to use it\n    * change stream_macros.h to generate code for the new registry-based\n      streaming API and update stream_test to use it.\n    * add kCompactOpts to json.h/cc (for unpretty-printing)\n    * add documentation for the new streaming API and some general docs\n    * delete old streaming API\n    \n    Change-Id: I490b08fa3520ba51704fa2507e3230dcb68f4eb3\n    Closes: 0b8adce 1941a38 6da4db9 704ae96 ab101b1 bab7e6d d0f291f\n            ecbaf88 f6f98d4\n```\n\nExample execution:\n```\njosh@cookie:/data/deleteme/coderepo$ python -B /tmp/close_git_bugs.py --log-level info -g ../bugrepo \n[INFO] Closing 0b8adce\n[INFO] Closing 1941a38\n[INFO] Closing 6da4db9\n[INFO] Closing 704ae96\n[INFO] Closing ab101b1\n[INFO] Closing bab7e6d\n[INFO] Closing d0f291f\n[INFO] Closing 0f7c7c3\n[INFO] Closing 12fc493\n[INFO] Closing 5fa508d\n[INFO] Closing 71ac52e\n[INFO] Closing 92c0d89\n[INFO] Closing cda90c0\n```\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/cheshirekow/dfe32a4a824b184eef9530aedd476876","files":null}]}
