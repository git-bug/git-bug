The presenter reimplements (or rather demonstrates) the major components of a blockchain using Git.\n\nHe identifies various attacks and then implements a solution to each one. He runs a validator on each commit, and cherry-picks rather than merging. He adds new data in new immutable files (rather than updating any common files, which frequently leads to merge conflicts). He uses git subtree so consumers don't need the entire chain at once (only miners do).\n\n[Git as Blockchain - Michael Perry - NDC Sydney 2018](https://youtu.be/k7U-V4EwoP8)","files":null}]}
