Git itself separated git and git-web, so you actually made a point against your own opinion.\n\u003e \n\nno @Anachron, you are getting it wrong. git-web *is* included by default\nwith git, it just requires you to install a web server on top of that.\n\ngit-bug comes with a very light webserver, so you dont have to install\none yourself, which you may (or not) never use.","files":null}]}
