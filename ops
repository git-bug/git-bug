Something like `chown -R \u003cuser\u003e:\u003cuser\u003e .`.\n\nOtherwise I don't see any reason why git-bug would require root access. Ignoring some cache files written directly in `.git/git-bug/`, all interaction with the repo are done through git itself. If `git` woks, git-bug should work as well.","files":null}]}
