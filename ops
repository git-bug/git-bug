I agree that it's still readable but I also find the extra separating space visually relaxing. Maybe a good compromise would be to remove only the top spacing ? What do I know, I'm no designer ;)\n\nFor terminal UIs space generally comes as a premium. Then again, it's probably one of those things that needs some sort of configuration as it's never going to satisfy everybody.\n\nAfter fiddling some more, this is what I get:\n![2020-07-15T132424](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017726/87539839-ee197680-c69e-11ea-8044-478e64463039.png)\n\nI removed the extra spaces between columns (except for last edit, since both columns are numbered). The space between the labels has gone too, except for a single separator between the label and the text, to conserve space in issues which are labeled with 4+ colors. With \"CMT\" as 3, it fits all issues up to 999, which is more than enough while also giving an average space of 2.\n\nThe \"LAST EDIT\" column at 16 still fits all values except for \"a long while ago\", which would be dumb to optimize for (\"a long ago\" or \"a while ago\" would perhaps be better).\n\nAs an argument for a config file, the hash length shouldn't probably be hard-coded, but at the very least fetched from the git config. Having used \"tig\" for quite a while, I'm also a big fan of the abbreviated dates (\"2d\" to indicate \"2 days ago\"), but having that as a default is probably going to throw off some people. Similarly, tig also does a great author abbreviation (which is also configurable) to conserve more space. After all, the \"sauce\" of the view should be the issue title.\n\n\u003e \u003e with \"LAST EDIT\" (which seems always \"a long while ago\" for some reason)\n\u003e \n\u003e this is due to #426\n\nThanks a lot for this! Now it works.","files":null}]}
