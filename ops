for the confirmation. i was able to reproduce this with a quick test (below); i imagine this is related to how we're using `go-git` (or we could just be making a bad assumption about what the push url should be -- you get the same error if you change your push url to `https`). \n\ni'll add this into the track for the next release (which got delayed due to `$LIFE/WORK/etc`, but is on its way again).\n\n```\n➜ git clone --single-branch --no-tags https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug.git .\nCloning into '.'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 20151, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100%
