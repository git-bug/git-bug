Eventually it would need to be upgraded into a more formal specification so that more interoperability can be created with other systems, but that's a ton of work ...\n\nPlease note an important point though: this document is outdated. With the [0.5.0 release](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/releases/tag/0.5.0), the `Identity`s have been separated into their own datastructure inside git, similar to what has been done for `Bug`. The reasoning is explained in the release log. I've meant to update the documentation, but well ... Help is super super welcome here.\n\n\u003e I think we would all be best of if all devs interested in a distributed bug tracker, would join here rather then create their own version.\n\nThat'd be awesome :-) I expect the next release to have a decent amount of attention considering that the bridges with Github and Gitlab are now functional, thanks to @A-Hilaly . Maybe that will be enough to grow the contributor list ?\n\n\u003e I like your project and your way of managing it a lot, and I think highly of your technical skills.\n\nThanks :-)","files":null}]}
