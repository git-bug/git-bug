Do you want these issues? If not I'll stop reporting them and wait for the next release.\n\nThe issue now is if I open the termui and register a comment on any issue, this comment will not appear in the termui until I restart it. It doesn't even refresh if I open a new issue in the termui and comment on that. See another gif showing the problem\n\n![termui-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5611071/45046586-7b84ec00-b06e-11e8-8dbf-8abbcdeb05bf.gif)","files":null}]}
