On disk, it's a serialized JSON.\n\nook, thanks! :-)\n\n\u003e Performance and storage. Less git object means less work to store them or move them around in the network. Having one operation per Blob would lead to a lot of tiny objects. Having OperationPack to group them reduce that. Also, when commit signature is implemented, a single signature will be necessary instead of one per operation.\n\nahhh that makes sense. if for example there would be ... one HTTP request for each `Operation`, instead of just per `OperationPack`, that could be quite some overhead.\nThanks! :-)","files":null}]}
