Really loving it, thus far.\nHowever, there's one little issue I've noticed.\n\nWhen I configured the GitHub bridge and thus created a new user, it didn't ask me for an avatar URL nor did it take the one from my GitHub.\n\nNow whenever I browse the local WebUI, all my co-workers have their avatars set but my own account appears as just a gray circle.\nI can't find a way to manually set an avatar URL either.\n\nSmall thing but I feel it's a bug or TODO.","files":null}]}
