It's great to see it progresses, but it still feels like the project is lacking documentation targeting users. A getting started document with some ideas on the workflow for using git-bug in a real development scenario would be a great addition to the project.\n\n@sergeevabc sounds like your current directory is not a git-repo. Are you sure you are issuing the command within a git repo? If you just cloned a repo and was issuing the command, you have to change your directory into the repo you just cloned.
