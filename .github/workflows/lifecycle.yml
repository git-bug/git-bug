        This bot triages issues in order to help the maintainers identify what
        needs attention, according to the following lifecycle rules:

        - After 90 days of inactivity, <code>lifecycle/idle</code> is applied
        - After 180 days of inactivity, <code>lifecycle/dormant</code> is applied

        The following actions remove the inactive status:

        - Removing the <code>lifecycle/*</code> label from this issue
        - Commenting on this issue
        - Adding a new assignee to this issue
        - Reopening this issue
        - Adding this issue to a milestone
        - Pinning this issue to the top of the issue board

        To avoid automatic lifecycle management of this issue, maintainers can
        add the <code>lifecycle/pinned</code> label.
